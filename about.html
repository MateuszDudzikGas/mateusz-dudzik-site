    <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
    <img src="20250417_133155 (1).jpg" alt="Mateusz Dudzik">
    <p>My name is Mateusz Dudzik, and I am a fully certified and experienced gas, plumbing, and heating engineer with over 10 years of hands-on experience in the industry. Based in Doncaster, I serve the entire Yorkshire area with a commitment to professionalism, efficiency, and exceptional craftsmanship.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects—from routine boiler servicing and emergency repairs, to full-scale installations of heating systems and underfloor heating. I specialize in working with the latest high-efficiency boilers and smart heating technologies, helping my clients reduce energy bills while maintaining comfort all year round.</p>

    <p>My services include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Installation of modern gas boilers</li>
      <li>Boiler servicing and fault diagnostics</li>
      <li>Complete plumbing and gas system installations</li>
      <li>Underfloor heating systems (Polypipe Overlay Plus)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I take great pride in my attention to detail and clean, precise workmanship. Whether I’m installing a new system or repairing an existing one, I treat every job as if I were working in my own home. I understand the value of clear communication, punctuality, and delivering exactly what the customer needs—no shortcuts, no compromises.</p>

    <p>As a Gas Safe Registered engineer, safety and compliance are top priorities in everything I do. I ensure every installation and repair is carried out to the highest safety standards and in accordance with UK regulations.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I’m a proud father and a family-oriented person. Becoming a dad has made me even more aware of how important it is to create safe and warm environments for families to live in. That personal motivation fuels my passion and pushes me to always deliver my very best on every project I take on.</p>

    <p>Whether you need a new boiler, regular maintenance, expert advice, or a complete heating solution tailored to your home—I'm here to help with a smile, skill, and a dedication you can count on.</p>
